# Science-Olympiad-Autograder
A Python project for grading Northwestern University Science Olympiad Invitational tests. The project was completed in 2023.

The project involved training a CNN model on MNIST digit datasets to do digit recognition from student answer sheets for a single Science Olympiad event, Fermi Questions. This was combined with another aspect to recognize the specific question and answer boxes on an answer sheet and comparing with answer keys to determine a final score. 

The model had a test accuracy of >99%. Certain changes were made on the test day to meet certain needs and may have resulted in one or more code files to throw errors (specifically scanner.py).
